Immediately upon entering you feel like you're stepping back in time. They've captured the old world charm, but put a modern spin on Italian classics. Everything was delicious! Had calamari, wild boar sausage and a pancetta salad for appetizers. All were really good (pancetta salad was the best). Then had the lobster ravioli, rigatoni vodka, branzino and pork chop \u0026 peppers. All great. Dessert was definitely a show stopper- amazing lemon cheesecake and a carrot cake with ginger ice cream. Desserts were really large- and I could've licked the plate if I had room. Of course, Jon and Andrew had numerous cocktails. Was a great night- hope to go back again!","rating":5,"_id":{"$oid":"5a804ea9fa3669088b59233a"}}],"dateReadable":"Feb 10 2018","date":{"$date":"2018-02-10T00:00:00.000Z"},"cuisine":"Italian","location":"Thompson Street","name":"Carbone","__v":0}
