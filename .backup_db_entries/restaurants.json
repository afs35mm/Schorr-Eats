Probably our 5th time at this restaurant- need to keep going there, just love it!! A new addition to the menu was the Chilled Udon Noodles in a peanut sauce- GREAT!! Andrew loves this dish and having it here made him really happy! We ended up with Chinese Sausage Fried Rice- which we didn't order but ate anyway after they placed it on our table. It has some sort of soft boiled egg in it- also a delicious addition! The wok charred broccoli and cantonese steamed sole were also new- both were great.

The only reason for 4 1/2 stars versus 5 is that Allison's mussels weren't cooked that well cooked  (slightly undercooked giving them a rubbery feel), but that is unusual for Red Hat.
